# How to Measure a Planet

How to Measure a Planet seeks to create imaginary topographies through the height difference of two places on the planet based on digital and analog data. In other words, the project is a method and a subsequent representation that metaphorically connects two points on the planet by means of topographic related data. Essentially, it is a device that converts the collected data into a 2D plane drawing. The machine consists of three servomotors that translate digital information from collected data into a mechanical force that moves a pencil. Each arm is controlled by one of the following data: temperature, height, and pressure, all of which are related to the elevation of a given place.

Inspired by the extreme contrast between the two places where I have lived (Santiago - Bremen), I wondered about the ways in which a possible connection between them could appear. In other words, how the geographical differences of two particular territories can generate a metaphorical bridge, which may express these differences in perception of the places we inhabit.

## How to make differences appear
Is it possible to connect two points on Earth based on their geographic characteristics? And more specifically, on their height differences? How can we create a conceptual crossover between technology, geography, and the way we perceive the places we inhabit? With this starting point, I began to think about a device that would help me to translate these landscape differences into a material state.
I started by using a barometric sensor connected to an Arduino microcontroller. The sensor captures humidity, temperature, and pressure. However, with a simple formula, it also calculates the altitude of a given place, considering that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation.
