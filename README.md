# How to Measure a Planet
Documentation plus further research

How to Measure a Planet seeks to create imaginary topographies through the height difference of two places on the planet based on digital and analog data. In other words, the project is a method and a subsequent representation that metaphorically connects two points on the planet by means of topographic-related data. Essentially, it is a device that converts the collected data into a 2D plane drawing. The machine consists of three servomotors that translate digital information from collected data into a mechanical force that moves a pencil. Each arm is controlled by one of the following data: temperature, height, and pressure, all of which are related to the elevation of a given place.
